## GitHub Pages Test

Testing out [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), a static site generator, to host Carpe Horas after WordPress became more trouble than it was worth.

Jekyll is highly blog-focused and may not be able to support all the things I'd like to do, but it's worth a shot.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/chanvrerie/chanvrerie.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
